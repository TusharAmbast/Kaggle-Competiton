ðŸ“Š Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots

A real-time, data-driven pricing engine that dynamically adjusts urban parking prices based on demand, occupancy, traffic, special days, and competitor behavior. This project uses Pathway for real-time data streaming and Bokeh for visualization.

ðŸ“ˆ Models Implemented

âœ… Model 1: Linear Pricing

Formula: Price_t+1 = Price_t + Î± * (Occupancy / Capacity)
Baseline model for simple elasticity

âœ… Model 2: Demand-Based Pricing

Demand Function:  Demand = Î± * (OccupancyRate) + Î² * (QueueLengthNorm) - Î³ * (Traffic) + Î´ * (IsSpecialDay) + Îµ * (VehicleTypeWeight)
Price Function:  Price = BasePrice * (1 + Î» * NormalizedDemand)

âœ… Model 3: Competitive Pricing

Haversine-based competitor lookup
Adjust price based on nearby competitor's price & occupancy

ðŸ“Š Real-Time Visualization

Implemented with Bokeh
Dynamic pricing line plots by parking lot ID
Supports top N busiest parking lots
Color-coded legends with auto-scaling

ðŸ“Œ Assumptions

Traffic data is mapped to numerical values
Queue length and demand normalized to 0-1
Nearby lots identified within 0.5 km
